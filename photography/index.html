          <h3>Nature Photography</h3>
          <p><h4>Description</h4><br>
            Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary. <br>
            "Nature photography" overlaps the fields of—and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography". </photography></p>

          <h3>Wild-Life Photography</h3>
          <p>
            <h4>Description</h4><br />
            Wildlife photographers use many different types of equipment to aid
            them in their quest to photograph their various subjects. The type
            of equipment needed by the photographer depends on what kind of
            animal he is shooting, what it will be doing, when it will be out,
            and the type of environment in which it lives. There are many
            different cameras, films, and other equipment to be used when
            photographing various subjects. Photographers sometimes use aerial
            photography and underwater photography to get pictures of some
            species. Wildlife photographing can be as easy as a walk in the park
            or as dangerous as swimming with sharks

        <br><p>Welcome to Course One of Photography Basics and Beyond: From Smartphone to DSLR! In these first 4 Modules you will gain the knowledge and the confidence that will help you make good choices as you consider qualities of the camera you own, and the qualities of the other types of digital cameras you might be considering. You will learn about the basic functions that most digital cameras have in common.  You will also go beyond the "technical" matters and learn about how you can make exciting pictures by emphasizing the aspects of Frame and Vantage Point to interpret old subjects in new ways.  Discovering accessories that photographers find useful, and the types of camera bags from mini to carry-on sized, is also in store for you.  You will also make your first photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, upload pictures to the web gallery and start interacting with your fellow learners in our "Gallery."  Let's get started with Module One!</p></li>
